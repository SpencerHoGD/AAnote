At the age of 32, I decided together with a friend to start playing the drums. I wanted to play Metallica. That turned out to be wishful thinking. I turned out to be quite rubbish at playing the drums. My friend, however, was definitely not as bad as me, and this surprised me because both of us had actively played a musical instrument during our childhood.

Both of us had drumming classes only once every two weeks, and neither of us owned a drum kit, so we couldn't practice at home. Our environmental conditions were really quite similar, yet she progressed much faster than me. How was this possible, and could I have predicted this?

You see, I am a behavioral geneticist. I study how genetics and the environment shape behavior, and it happens to be that my work involves musicality and music engagement. Therefore, I am quite well aware of the fact that differences between people in musicality are not only due to environmental conditions; genetic factors also play a role. And this, by the way, applies to all human behavior. You can think of why some people are more curious than others, how many books you read, if you like doing sports, like eating carrots—you name it.

So how do we know this? Since the early 1900s, twin studies have shown this. Twin studies make use of the fact that there are two types of twins in this world. There are identical twins, derived from one fertilized single egg cell, and therefore they share the same DNA. And there are non-identical twins, derived from two different fertilized egg cells, just like regular brothers and sisters. Therefore, on average, they share 50% of their DNA.

Twin studies compare these two types of twins and their resemblance. For example, if an identical twin is highly musically talented, then his or her co-twin is most of the time musically gifted as well. However, in non-identical twins, if one of them is musically gifted, it's far less likely that their co-twin is also musically talented. This suggests that genetic factors play a role in musicality.

These twin studies calculate something called heritability. A heritability estimate tells us how much a specific behavior is influenced by genetic factors. For music, several twin studies taken together showed that differences between people are 40% explained by genetic factors. This doesn't only apply to musical abilities and musical skills but also to whether you like to engage in music, how often you listen to music, and how much you practice. All of these music-related behaviors are partly influenced by the genes we inherit. 

This results in musicality clustering in families. In other words, if someone in your family is musically talented, there is a higher chance that other people in the family will also have musical talent. I'm sure you can think of some examples: there's the Jackson 5, there's ACDC, and did you know that the Bach family actually consisted of around 50 highly talented musicians?

Clustering can also occur because they share the same family environment that influences them, but it will inevitably happen when genetic factors play a role. So what can we do with this information, knowing that musicality is partly influenced by our genes? Well, researchers need to be aware of this when we study how the environment shapes our musical abilities. For example, if we want to see how regular practice affects musical abilities, we can't ignore the fact that there are different genetic starting points. The effect of practice varies depending on people's genetic makeup.

So you might be wondering, can I apply this 40% heritability of musicality to my own lack of drumming skills? Well, the answer is no. It doesn't mean that my personal musicality comes 40% directly from my genes. Instead, it helps explain why some people are highly musically talented, others less so, and some not at all. Those differences between people are explained 40% by genetic differences between them and 60% by environmental differences.

Despite realizing that I probably don’t possess the genetic factors for drumming, the fact that genes partly influence musicality couldn't have personally warned me about my poor skills. So now you know: twin studies tell us how much human behavior or specific traits are influenced by genetic factors, but they do not tell us which exact genetic variants are involved or where they are.

This only became possible to study after the discovery of the DNA helix in 1953. It became clear that our human makeup, our architecture, is coded in DNA. Human DNA contains millions of genetic variants and thousands of genes, which are segments of DNA containing genetic variants. Years of research since then have shown that human behavior is influenced by many genetic variants, and these variants don’t influence only one type of behavior but many types.

There isn’t one gene for musicality, for example—it’s much more complex than that. Luckily, over the years, as more knowledge was gained, measuring people’s DNA became easier, cheaper, and faster. This allowed researchers to conduct genome-wide association studies (GWAS), where genetic variants are compared between people to see if they are related to behavior.

These studies actually tell us where these genetic variants are. For example, a study in 600,000 people compared the DNA of people who claimed they can clap in time to a musical beat and those who cannot. It showed exactly where in the DNA, and how much, these genetic variants were involved in beat clapping. My colleagues and I have studied this further and saw that people with a genetic predisposition for beat clapping (a score that can be calculated once you know the GWAS results) perform better on musical tests, listen to music more often, and engage in music more.

Could calculating this score for myself have warned me about my skills? I calculated this score not for myself but for Ludwig van Beethoven. You may have heard of him—he’s undoubtedly a musical genius. Before passing away, Beethoven wrote a letter to his brother asking if it could be found out what had been going on with him since he had been very ill during his life.

A few years ago, researchers collected eight hair strands from different sources, measured Beethoven’s DNA, and made it publicly available. Beethoven’s genetic predisposition for beat clapping turned out to be very, very low—you practically can’t score lower. Does this mean genetics are not important for musicality? No, twin studies make it clear that genetic factors play a role in musicality. Does this mean Beethoven succeeded only due to environmental conditions? No, we cannot conclude that either.

What this shows—and researchers in my field were already aware of this, with Beethoven serving as the perfect illustration—is that these scores, these polygenic scores, cannot reliably predict behavior like musicality for a single individual. These scores do not capture the full picture of genetic influences. When GWAS become larger, they will get better at predicting, especially when musicality is measured more precisely than just clapping to a beat.

These scores are valuable when applied to large groups to detect small differences rather than to single individuals. Don’t forget, though, that when predicting based on genetic information, this represents only half of the story. The environment still plays a huge role. Why bother using these genetic techniques at all, then? Well, it’s not a matter of nature versus nurture—it’s nature and nurture. They are intertwined. Genes and the environment interact, and they correlate with each other.

These scores help researchers like me study gene-environment interplay and how it works, increasing our knowledge about the development of musicality. Over time, if these scores improve and I tested my genetic predisposition for drumming, finding I had none, would I have wanted to know? No. For me, drumming was the highlight of the week—an hour of loud banging, a rush of adrenaline, clearing my mind, and so much laughter with my teacher and my friend.

Music is really about letting loose and having fun. I think we should all engage with music in a way that works best for us, whether it's becoming a great musician, using music for emotional regulation, or just having fun. Music is for everyone.
