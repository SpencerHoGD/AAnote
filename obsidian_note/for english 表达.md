Recommendations for Using Arch Without a Desktop Environment

](https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/?f=flair_name%3A%22Help%22)

As a new user of Arch and Linux in general, I want to know how I can maximize my experience using Arch without a desktop environment, because of how light it is. Even though I don't want a desktop environment, I would like to at least browse the web and make the UI look just a tad bit better, because Arch by itself looks pretty bare-bones. Is there anything that I could do just to improve the overall user-friendliness of Arch? Any help is appreciated.
