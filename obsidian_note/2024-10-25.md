Chrome history file

```The history is saved in a file called `History` in `%LocalAppData%\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default` (Windows), `~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default` (macOS) or `~/.config/google-chrome/Default` (Linux). That file is an SQLite3 database which can be read with any compatible client, so it shouldn't be too hard to export the data you want. If you want to backup and restore everything you can just copy the entire directory.
